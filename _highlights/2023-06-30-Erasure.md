title: "Quantum Error Correction with Metastable States of Trapped Ions Using Erasure Conversion"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-06-30-Erasure
excerpt: "Erasures, or errors with known locations, are more favorable than typical Pauli errors for quantum error correction. We suggest converting physical noise to erasures on trapped ions by using metastable atomic states as qubit states. Then we compare the error-correction performance of metastable and ground qubits under various physical constraints."
