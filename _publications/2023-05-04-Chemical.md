collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-05-04-Chemical
excerpt: "Analog-quantum simulation derived from tracking the evolution of trapped-ion systems holds the potential to simulate molecular quantum dynamics that is beyond the reach of classical-digital strategies. This Review explores the prospects for developing this quantum advantage."
