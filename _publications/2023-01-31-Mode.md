collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2023-01-31-Mode
excerpt: "To achieve high-fidelity operations on a long ion chain, the motional-mode parameters must be efficiently characterized with high accuracy. We develop and explore physical models that accurately predict both magnitude and sign of the Lamb-Dicke parameters, as well as devise a parallelized and efficient characterization protocol."
