title: "Quantum Simulation of Spin-Boson Models with Structured Bath"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-05-24-SpinBoson
excerpt: "We simulate the spin-boson model, a paradigmatic model of non-Markovian open quantum systems, using the motional modes of trapped ions. The dissipative behavior of the dynamics is captured by applying randomness to the control parameters."
