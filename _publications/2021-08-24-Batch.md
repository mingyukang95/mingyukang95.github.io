collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2021-08-24-Batch
excerpt: 'We applied batch optimization, a technique widely used in machine learning, to finding the laser pulses for two-qubit gates on trapped ions. We experimentally verified that the new method improves the gate's robustness to offsets of the motional-mode frequencies.'
