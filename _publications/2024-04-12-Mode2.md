title: "Pulse Optimization for High-Precision Motional-Mode Characterization in Trapped-Ion Quantum Computers"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-04-12-Mode2
excerpt: "Pulse optimization is not only for quantum gates; it can also be used for calibration (characterization of system parameters). Here we suggest using pulse optimization to characterize the motional-mode parameters (Lamb-Dicke parameters) of trapped ions with higher accuracy,  which is necessary for achieving high-fidelity operations on a chain of many ions."
