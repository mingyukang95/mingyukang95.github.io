title: "Pulse optimization for high-precision motional-mode characterization in trapped-ion quantum computers"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2024-04-12-Mode2
excerpt: "Pulse optimization is not limited to quantum gates; it can also be used for calibration (characterization of system parameters). Here we use pulse optimization to characterize the motional-mode parameters (Lamb-Dicke parameters) of trapped ions with higher accuracy,  which is necessary for achieving high-fidelity operations on a chain of many ions."
