Iâ€™m a Physics PhD candidate at Duke University, working as a theorist in [Brown Lab](https://brownlab.pratt.duke.edu/). I finished my undergrad in Stanford University. I'm originally from South Korea. 

I am excited about building quantum computers and the physics behind it! My research interest is in quantum error correction, quantum simulation, and quantum control.

Besides physics, I enjoy stand-up comedy and basketball.
