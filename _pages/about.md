Iâ€™m a Physics PhD candidate at Duke University, working as a theorist in [Brown Lab](https://brownlab.pratt.duke.edu/). I finished my undergrad in Stanford University. I'm originally from South Korea. 

I am excited about using quantum physics to build quantum computers/simulators, and using quantum computers/simulators to better understand the quantum Nature. My research interest is in quantum error correction, quantum simulation, and quantum control. Yes, I said ``quantum'' seven times. 

Besides physics, I enjoy stand-up comedy and basketball.
