Iâ€™m a Physics PhD candidate at Duke University, working as a theorist in [Brown Lab](https://brownlab.pratt.duke.edu/). I finished my undergrad in Stanford University. I'm originally from South Korea. 

I am excited about using quantum physics to build quantum computers/simulators, and using quantum computers/simulators to better understand the quantum Nature. My research interest is in quantum error correction, quantum simulation, and quantum control. 

Debopriyo Biswas and I have been making a Youtube series [Quantum News Monthly](https://mkangquantum.github.io/quantum-news-monthly/). We make 10-15 min video on exciting news and publications in the field of quantum physics and quantum computing each month, so check out if you're interested! 

Besides physics, I enjoy stand-up comedy and basketball.
